# Exercise 2: Discount

# User input for price and discount:
original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
discount_percent = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Calculate discount amount:
discount_amount = original_price * (discount_percent / 100)

# Calculate final price:
final_price = original_price - discount_amount

# Display result:
print(f"Final Price = ${final_price:.2f}")
