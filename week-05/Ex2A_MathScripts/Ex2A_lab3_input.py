# Calculating tips using input()

bill = float(input("What is the restaurant bill?: "))
tip_percent = float(input("What tip percent do you want to give?: "))

tip = bill * (tip_percent / 100)

print("The tip on a $" + str(bill) + " restaurant bill is $" + str(tip))

# Observation:
# input() always stores the user's answer as a string.
# To calculate, I had to convert it with float().
# A possible pitfall is that the program will crash if the user types words instead of numbers.
